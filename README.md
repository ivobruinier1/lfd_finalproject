## Running the code
First, install packages: \
`pip install -r requirements.txt` \
To experiment with LSTM run `final_assignment.ipynb` \
To experiment with pretrained language models  run `final_assignment.ipynb` \
To experiment with SVM `svm.py` 

## Note

- The Glove 6B embeddings used for `final_assignment.ipynb` can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ouhammourachid/glove-6b-json-format)
- It is recommended to run all experiments with LSTMs or PLMs with a GPU
- For the experiments with the LSTMs and PLMs Google Colab has been used therefore a notebook is commited and command line arguments have not been implemented.
